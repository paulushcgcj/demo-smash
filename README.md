## Project Overview

**Smash** is a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application designed to test and demonstrate functionalities using different frontend and backend frameworks. This repository includes:

- **Frontend**: Implementations using React, Vue, and Angular.
- **Backend**: Implementations using Spring Boot with both reactive and non-reactive approaches.

## Frontend Implementations

The front end uses [carbon as its design system and component library](https://carbondesignsystem.com/) for visuals. All projects are written in typescript. Both [react](#react) and [vue](#vue) were bootstrapped using [Vite](https://vite.dev/)

### React

The [React](https://react.dev/) implementation can be found in the `react` directory. It is designed to provide a modern, component-based user interface.

### Vue

The [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) implementation resides in the `vue` directory. It offers a flexible and approachable framework for building interactive user interfaces.

### Angular

The [Angular](https://angular.dev/) implementation is located in the `angular` directory. It features a robust framework for building dynamic, single-page applications.

## Backend Implementations

### Spring Boot Reactive

The Spring Boot reactive backend is located in the `springreactive` directory. This implementation uses reactive programming principles to handle asynchronous data streams.

### Spring Boot Non-Reactive

The Spring Boot non-reactive backend can be found in the `springmvc` directory. This implementation uses traditional synchronous programming methods.

### Quarkus Reactive

The [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/) backend can be found in the `quarkus` directory. This implementation uses reactive programming principles to handle asynchronous data streams.

### Micronaut

The [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/) backend can be found in the `micronaut` directory.
